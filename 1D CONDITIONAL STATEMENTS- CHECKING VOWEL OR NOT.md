## Experiment No: 1d â€“ Conditional Statements- Printing User Type Based on Choice

## AIM  
To write a Python program to print the type of user based on the user's choice using if..elif..else statements.
## ALGORITHM  
1. Start the program.  
2. Accept a numeric input from the user.  
3. Check the input:  
   - If input is `1`, print "Admin".  
   - If input is `2`, print "Editor".  
   - If input is `3`, print "Guest".  
   - Otherwise, print "Wrong entry".  
4. End the program.


## PROGRAM
```python

a = int(input())
if a == 1:
    print('Admin')
elif a == 2:
    print('Editor')
elif a == 3:
    print('Guest')
else:
    print('Wrong entry')
